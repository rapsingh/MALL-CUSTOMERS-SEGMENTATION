# MALL-CUSTOMERS-SEGMENTATION
In this project, the aim is to segment customers into groups with different income age and spending scores in a mall and derive an understanding of it from various charts and exploratory analysis.  The clustering of customers will provide valuable information on which group has higher spending score and which group mall should target to increase profits. Model is trained using the K-Means algorithm by which we segment customers into different groups.
